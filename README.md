 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company that specializes in providing financial planning services, including savings, retirement plans, investment advice, and insurance coverage. They have developed a web-based API and are actively working towards enhancing the security of their software systems. In order to safeguard their organization against external threats, they approached Global Rain for their expertise in conducting a comprehensive vulnerability assessment of their web application.
   
 2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I carefully examined Artemis Financials software through a manual review and static testing. It is crucial to prioritize coding practices in order to safeguard sensitive client data and adhere to global data protection regulations. By prioritizing software security, we can build trust with our clients and stakeholders, minimize the potential for losses resulting from breaches, and ensure compliance with legal obligations.

 3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Identifying vulnerabilities in the dependencies used in the project was quite challenging for me. I faced difficulties in coding them, which ultimately led to my failure to complete Project 2. It's important not to overlook vulnerabilities in dependencies, as they can pose security risks. On a positive note, the structured approach to the assessment proved helpful as it made documenting and prioritizing vulnerabilities much easier.
 
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I suggest implementing input validation systems, improving error handling protocols, and integrating encryption methods. In the future, it would be beneficial to combine automated scanning tools with code reviews to conduct a thorough vulnerability assessment. Determining the mitigation techniques will depend on the severity and impact of each identified vulnerability.

5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

Once the code has been refactored, my next step would be to conduct a thorough series of tests to ensure that the application functions properly and maintains its security. Additionally, I would re-examine the vulnerability assessment tools to detect any potential new vulnerabilities that may have been introduced.
 
 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I incorporated the Maven Dependency Check Plugin into my static testing process and made sure to adhere to secure coding best practices. These practices and tools are incredibly valuable for future assignments as they allow for the quick identification and mitigation of vulnerabilities.
 
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I can provide a detailed vulnerability assessment report for Artemis Financial, highlighting my expertise in identifying, documenting, and suggesting ways to address different vulnerabilities found in web-based software applications. This report will showcase my capabilities in secure coding, vulnerability assessment, and creating practical mitigation strategies.
